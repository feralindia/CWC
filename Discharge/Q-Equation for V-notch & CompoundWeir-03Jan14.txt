Discharge equation for standard 90 deg sharp-crested V-notch at Hosagadde site, Sirsi
Discharge, Q = 4969 * (H ^ 2.5)
Q = m3/hour
H = meters above the crest = [stage (in meters) – 0.47]

Discharge equation for sharp-crested V+Rectangle composite weir at the Niligiri’s site:
Qt = {8/15 * C1 * sqrt(2*g) * [H2/3 – h2/3]} + {2/3 * C2 * sqrt(2 * g) * [2b] * h3/2}
Qt = Theoretical discharge, m3/sec
Actual discharge, Qa = 1.09 * Qt
g = 9.81 m/sec2
H = depth of flow above the V-notch crest, meters = [stage (in meters) – 0.095] Corrected to .0.1610 on Sept 16th 2014 based on salt dilution experiment.
h = depth of flow above the rectangular weir crest (or above the V-notch section), meters = (H – 0.40)
b = rectangular weir length on each side, meters = 0.21 m
C1 = discharge coefficient for V-notch weir = 0.59
C2 = discharge coefficient for rectangular weir = 0.58
