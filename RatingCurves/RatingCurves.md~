# Deriving Rating Curves

## Introduction

This document explains the code used to derive the rating curve from four different methods used during this project. These are:

1. Flow rates or velocity measurements taken using pygmy flow meters in combination with stream profiles.

2. Flow rates measured using a floating orange in combination with stream profiles.

3. Discharges measured using the salt dilution 'slug' method.

4. Discharges measured using the salt dilution constant release method.
