#+TITLE: ToDo for sorting out differences in discharge estimates

1. See whether there is a significant difference in the calibration readings if we use the same linear model with and then without the "brass" portion of the capacitance probe.
2. Fix the discharge function for flumes so it is as per values provided in the internet, i.e. ignore values provided by Srinivas Badiger.
3. See if there is a change in the s/d curve over time for the same stage.
4. Take low stages and see if the s/d shifts.
5. Take predicted values of the s/d and compare with actual measurements.
