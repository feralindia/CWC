# TODO

Issues with the rain gauge processing:

* Datestamp keeps switching back to GMT when timedate package is used. Setting time zone while initialising doesn't seem to work.
* Need to clean up code, insert if-else statements to allow a master routine to turn sub-routines on and off.

# Wish List

Link up code to GIS. Need to discuss with JK, NC & SV on what sort of outputs we should be looking at.
